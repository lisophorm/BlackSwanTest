**Black Swan - Front End Developer Test**

This is what I could achieve with 6 hours of work.
This is also my way of prioritizing when developing a prototype.

Candidate:**Alfonso Florio**

Working url: **http://tom.crystal-bits.co.uk**

Tested with: **IE 11 - Chrome and Firefox**



Frameworks and libriaries:

AngularJS 1.5 

Angular Material

UI-router

Tools used:Gulp / Bower / NodeJs LiveReload

Bespoke components:
**GitHubFeed.factory**: handles the data logic of the application. Interacts with the GitHub API

**Preload.factory**: handles a preload transtion for the loading states and for the change of URL.
It has a safety timeout, in case of unxpected exceptions.

**SearchResults.service**: preserves data across views/states - it stores also the scroll position of the search results


***** Pagination**
With more time I would have used infinite scroll
